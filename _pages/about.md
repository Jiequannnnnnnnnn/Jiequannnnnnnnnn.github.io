Hi, I am a second-year M.S. student in Symbolic Systems at Stanford University, where I am fortunate to work with Michael C. Frank (Language and Cognition Lab) and Vivek Kulkarni (Stanford NLP Lab). 

My research focuses on 1) applying machine learning to study language acquisition and language changes 2) using natural language processing techniques in educational applications. In general, I am interested in studying how human and machine learn language differently. 

Prior to Stanford, I spent four years as an undergraduate at Emory University, where I worked with Jinho D. Choi in Emory NLP Lab. I've also spent time at CMU (working with Brian MacWhinney), ETS Research (working with Martin Chodorow, Nitin Madnani, Aoife Cahill), and Apple Natural Language Processing Group (working with Bing Zhao, Vivek Kumar Rangarajan Sridhar).
