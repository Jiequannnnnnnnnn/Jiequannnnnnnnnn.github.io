Hi, I am a second-year M.S. student in [Symbolic Systems](https://symsys.stanford.edu/) at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/), where I am fortunate to work with [Michael C. Frank](https://web.stanford.edu/~mcfrank/) ([The Stanford Language and Cognition Lab](http://langcog.stanford.edu/)) and [Vivek Kulkarni](https://viveksck.github.io/) ([Stanford NLP Lab](https://nlp.stanford.edu/people/)). *I am actively applying for PhD programs in natural language processing, computational linguistics, and computational social science for Fall 2020.*

My research focuses on studying language and cognition with machine learning. My goal for pursuing a Ph.D degree is to not only improve the natural language processing (NLP) benchmarks but also to understand how machine and human actually learn language. I also want to apply ML and NLP techniques in the field of education and sustainable development. 

Overall, my research interest includes but not limited to:
*  Natural Language Processing, Computational Linguistics, Machine Learning
*  Computational Social Science, Computational Cognitive Science
*  Language Variation and Change, Social Reasoning, Language Acquisition 
*  Machine Learning for Education and Sustainable Development

Prior to Stanford, I spent four years as an undergraduate at [Emory University](http://www.emory.edu/home/index.html), where I worked with [Jinho D. Choi](http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/~choi/home.html) in [Emory NLP Lab](http://nlp.mathcs.emory.edu/home.html). 

I've also spent time at 
* [CMU](https://www.cmu.edu/) (working with [Brian MacWhinney](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=V8EhIsIAAAAJ&hl=en))
* [Educational Testing Service (ETS) Research](https://www.ets.org/) (working with [Martin Chodorow](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PuwfixYAAAAJ&hl=en), [Nitin Madnani](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=ow3PIFcAAAAJ), [Aoife Cahill](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=1a-TXfYAAAAJ))
* Apple Inc. (working with [Bing Zhao](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~bzhao/), [Vivek Kumar Rangarajan Sridhar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VfezouUAAAAJ&hl=en))
